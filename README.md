# Thulium Music Player (STM32 Version)

STM32 Version of Thulium Music Player, which is a simple program aimed to play textualized music on any platforms or devices.

This program was originally designed for STM32F427IIHx, but it can easily be ported to other microcontrollers. Simply change the macros in **[Task_AudioPlay.c](https://github.com/obstudio/ThuliumMusic-STM32/blob/master/Task/Src/Task_AudioPlay.c)** to use a different TIM channel.

Development environment: **[STM32CubeMX](http://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html)** and **[Keil MDK-ARM ÂµVision5](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/uvision/)**.
